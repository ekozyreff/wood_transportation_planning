# Wood Transportation Planning

The aim of this project was to create a tool to plan the logistics of wood transportation in the production chain of a paper manufacturing company.

Paper is made from wood, which has to be transported from the forest to the factories (sometimes going through intermediate yards).

This process is complext because it involves crucial (and costly) aspects, such as:

- Current stock levels on the forest, intermediate years and factories
- Specificities of the demand on the factories (e.g. type of product, wood density and wood age)
- Accessability to roads, depending on wheather conditions
- Desired stock levels (minimum and maximum) on intermediate years and factories
- Desired transportation amounts (minimum and maximum) for specific origin-destination pairs

Once a transportation plan is ready, a large number of trucks must be designated to pick up and drop its loads. This is done on a daily basis and is a procedure that is revised and refined on the go.

To assist the planning of this process, a tool was created using an interface in Excel, where the user can set up limits and analyze the inputs.
